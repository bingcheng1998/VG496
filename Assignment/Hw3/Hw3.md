# case-study procedure on the Volkswagen case



1. List as many ethical issues as possible - remember, ethical issues concern what individuals/organizations should or should not have done/might or might not have done, and are posed in the form of a question - providing a brief explanation for why the issue is ethical in nature.
2. Choose the most important one - or reformulate a new issue that encapsulates multiple issues from step one - providing a brief (one- to two-sentence) explanation for why this issue is the most important.  
3. List facts that would help to resolve the most important issue/answer the question - paying special attention to material, individual, and organizational facts - as well as identifying any relevant missing facts.
4. Make reasonable assumptions regarding missing facts, including brief justifications for your assumptions.
5. Clarify the use of any potentially ambiguous terminology you've used so far - for example, technical or value terms, like "safe," "good," and "responsible."
6. Identify ethical principles that would be relevant for resolving the issue under consideration, starting with the principles for ethical global engineering outlined in chapter four, providing a very brief explanation of why they are relevant. If these principles conflict, then be sure to prioritize them, explaining which ones would be more/less important and why. If you think additional principles apply, then list these as well.
7. Review the process thus far, making sure you have listed all relevant facts, as well as clarified any remaining potentially ambiguous terminology.
8. Based on the previous steps, resolve the issue under consideration, answering the question you identified in step 2. Additionally, give a brief justification for your answer.
9. Identify practical constraints, listing any that could reasonably be said to excuse either individuals or organizations from the answer given.
10. Finally, based on the previous steps of the case study analysis, explain how ethical problems might have been avoided in the first place.

1. 列出尽可能多的道德问题 - 请记住，道德问题涉及个人/组织应该或不应该做或可能做或不做的事情，并以问题的形式提出 - 提供一个简要解释为什么问题是道德本质。

   这些费用涉及被称为“失败装置”的软件，用于测试大众柴油汽车氮氧化物排放的测试。使用该软件的大众汽车的危险排放量比固定排放测试所测量的排放量高15-35倍

   The charges related to software known as “defeat devices” installed to
   trick tests measuring nitrogen oxide emissions from VW diesel automobiles.
   Hazardous emissions from the VW cars with the software were 15–35 times
   higher than those measured by the fixed emissions tests

   在国际清洁运输委员会的资助下，西弗吉尼亚大学的工程师决定“大众汽车在美国汽车排放测试中作弊” 

   德国汽车工业协会（Verband der Automobilindustrie）代表德国，也许是世界上最重要的汽车公司，在这个问题上保持相对沉默

   Since 2009, VW cars in the United States outfitted with defeat devices “produced doctored results” when tested for nitrogen oxide emissions

   From late 2012 to May 2013, supported by a grant from the International Council on Clean Transportation, engineers from West Virginia University determined “Volkswagen was cheating on US vehicle emission tests” 

   the CEO, Winterkorn, said in a com-
   pany statement that he was “shocked by the events of the past few days”—
   although there were indications Winterkorn knew of and ignored issues related
   to VW emissions going back some time

   VW claimed “higher nitrogen oxide emissions” were caused by “technical glitches”

   German regulators “made only the briefest of statements on the scan-
   dal, preferring to focus on how to fix the problem of the vehicles” (Copley,
   2015). The German Association of the Automotive Industry (Verband der
   Automobilindustrie)—representing Germany's and perhaps the world's fore-
   most car companies—remained relatively silent on the matter. Additionally, the
   Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA—Federal Motor Transport Authority of Germany)
   appeared to publicly support VW, 

   Michael Horn—responsible for VW US
   operations—bluntly stated that VW “totally screwed up,” admitting the fault
   of VW and promising to fully cooperate with the upcoming investigation and
   future regulations

   - Should VW install “defeat devices” to trick on tests to measure nitrogen oxide emit from tha car ?
     - This software will change the output of the fixed emissions tests.
   - Should VW produced doctored results on tests to measure nitrogen oxide emit from tha car ?
     - If they do, the measured result by the fixed emissions tests will be good looking, but It will cause safety latent danger.
   - Should International Council on Clean Transportation surpport engineers to check whether “Volkswagen was cheating on US vehicle emission tests ?”
     - If they don't surpport to this research, what VW did may not be found.
   - Should the CEO of VW pretends that he doesn't know "the events of the past few days ?"
     - Every one knew that he must know that. But if he admit that, he will be against the law.
   - Should VW claim that “higher nitrogen oxide emissions” were caused by “technical glitches ?”
     - By saying that, he may escape the blame, but if what he did were exposured, he'll be in danger.
   - Should German regulators only "focus on how to fix the problem of the vehicles ?"
     - If they don't, they must punish VW, which is not acceptable by them. If they do, they will lose their credibility.
   - Should Verband der Automobilindustrie remained silent relatively ?
     - If they don't they must admit their fault, which is not acceptable by them, but if they do, they will lose their credibility.
   - Should Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt support VW publicly?
     - If they don't VW may be punished. If they do, they will lose their credibility.

2. 选择最重要的一个 - 或重新制定一个包含第一步中的多个问题的新问题 - 提供一个简短的（一到两个句子）解释为什么这个问题是最重要的。

   "Should VW produced doctored results on tests to measure nitrogen oxide emit from tha car" is the most important one. 

   Though this may be one of the "most effective way" to decrease the nitrogen oxide emit from tha car, but it take risks. VW had a reputation for assemble reliable cars, supporting Germany engineering reputation. If they trick on tests to measure nitrogen oxide emit from tha car, the outcome of the measurement will be good looking, but it take risks. If what they did were found by others, they will lose their credibility, and VW's stock will drop a lot.

3. 列出有助于解决最重要问题/回答问题的事实 - 特别关注材料，个人和组织事实 - 以及识别任何相关的缺失事实。

   VW's stock dropped by 50%—from Mar. of 2015 to 2016

   该软件已安装在数百万辆汽车上

   ==关于大众汽车排放的问题早在2012年就开始了

   Guardian newspaper estimated that VW cars could be “responsible for nearly
   1 million tonnes of air pollution every year

   On Oct. 6, the VW Group of America
   returned three Cars.com awards it had previously received for clean diesel ve-
   hicles

   VW had enjoyed a reputation for producing reliable vehicles, supporting the national engineering reputation of Germany and Germans as honest and diligent workers. 

   When operating normally however—driving on the
   road—the cars produced “emissions of nitrogen oxide up to nine times EPA's
   standard”

   The software had been installed in millions of vehicles:

    Questions regarding the emissions of VW automobiles began as early
   as 2012.

   From late 2012 to May 2013, supported by a grant from the International
   Council on Clean Transportation, engineers from West Virginia University de-
   termined “Volkswagen was cheating on US vehicle emission tests” 

   German regulators “made only the briefest of statements on the scan-
   dal, preferring to focus on how to fix the problem of the vehicles” (Copley,
   2015). The German Association of the Automotive Industry (Verband der
   Automobilindustrie)—representing Germany's and perhaps the world's fore-
   most car companies—remained relatively silent on the matter. Additionally, the
   Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA—Federal Motor Transport Authority of Germany)
   appeared to publicly support VW,

   ###Facts provided

   - Hazardous emissions emitted from the VW cars with “defeat devices” were lower by the fixed emissions tests than on the road.
   - VW's stock dropped to 50% since Mar. 2015 ~ 2016
   - VW cars "responsible for nearly 1 million tonnes of air pollution every year."
   - The VW Group of America returned three awards from Cars.com.
   - VW had been honored by produce good vehicles.
   - VW had supported the national engineering reputation of Germany. 
   - VW had have honest and diligent workers. 
   - When driving on the road, the cars from VW produced “emissions of nitrogen oxide up to nine times EPA's standard”
   - The trick software had been installed in millions of cars from VW.
   - The emission problems of VW cars began since 2012.
   - West Virginia University's engineers determined “Volkswagen was cheating on US vehicle emission tests” 
   - German regulators only "focus on how to fix the problem of the vehicles."
   - Verband der Automobilindustrie remained silent relatively.
   - Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt support VW publicly.
   - Michael Horn state that VW “totally screwed up and admitting the fault.”

   - Should Michael Horn state that VW “totally screwed up and admitting the fault?”

   ###Facts not provided but relevant 

   - Did the employees of VW knew what the caompany did?
   - Do nitrogen oxide emit from tha car is dangerous to humanbeings?
   - What made VW to made the decision to produce cars with “defeat devices”?

   ---

4. 对缺失的事实做出合理的假设，包括对您的假设的简要理由。

   ### Making Reasonable Assumptions for facts not provided but relevant 

   - Did the employees of VW knew what the company did?
     - 如果知道，应该有人阻止。如果没有，为什么？如果有，为什么到现在才爆出来？
     - If they know this issue that VW sell cars with discharge issues and it will cause safety latent danger, they should talk to their employer, VW or public what they knows directly to the public, making a statement to the media, such that the public will bot be hurt. But they didn't do it for at least two year. It may because they need their job and VW gave them many bonus such that they were contrary to conscience. If there really were some people who did report this to media, why the secret were kept for so long time?
   - Do nitrogen oxide emit from tha car is dangerous to humanbeings?
     - 应该有害，这样才引起群众关注。
     - Nitrogen oxide emit from tha car should be dangerous to humanbeings. If nitrogen oxide emit from tha car is just like carbon dioxide and cause no damage to the environment, there should be no such amount of people who make their eyes so close to this event.
   - What made VW to made the decision to produce cars with “defeat devices”?
     - 作为一个有责任心的大公司，为什么这么冒险？是否知道被爆出的后果？
     - As one of the best company in the car industry, VW were suffer a lot of pressure. If there were not as good as people thought or there were any other car company which invent cars with higher performance, VW's position will not be guaranteed. So they want to manufacturing gimmucks without strength.

5. 澄清到目前为止您使用的任何可能含糊不清的术语的使用 - 例如，技术或价值术语，如“安全”，“好”和“负责任”。

   - trick: cheat on the tests to measure nitrogen oxide emit from tha car.
   - defeat devices: devices that can trick inspectors.
   - clean program: program installed to trick tests measuring nitrogen oxide emissions from VW diesel automobiles.
   - technical glitches: program installed to trick tests is not programed to trick, it's just glitches that caused this issue.

6. 确定与解决所考虑问题相关的道德原则，从第四章中概述的道德全球工程原则开始，简要说明其相关原因。如果这些原则发生冲突，那么一定要优先考虑这些原则，然后解释哪些原则会更重要/更不重要。如果您认为其他原则适用，请列出这些原则。

   Since VW is a big company and its cars will influence many families, which means responsibilities related to engineers worked for VW are strongly connected. Referring to the list in Appendix 1, basic ethical principles include principles on related to public safety (1), human rights (2), environmental protection (3) and truthful disclosure (6). 

   While does these questions are related to the VW? This cars were said to be clean and environmental helpful. And VW has the duty to make sure what they made are reliable. Which means it's VW which should make this prodeuct safety. According to ethical principles for employees, engineers should "obey all legitimate, job-related directives"(1) and "avoid actions that harm the corporation in acting on behalf of the organization"(4), but there is a conflict. As right for enginner as employees says, they should "blow the whistle (externally or internally) if, in their professional judgments, the physical safety of the public will be endangered as a result of their failures to act" (7) and "inform the public of engineering decisions that have the potential to seriously harm the physical welfare of the public"(9). 

   Like the case of ehical analyses, engineers in VW should make his decision on his knowledge and take his responsibilities, and VW should bear public responsibility.

7. 审查到目前为止的流程，确保列出所有相关事实，并澄清任何剩余的可能含糊不清的术语。

   It's not hard to find that VW cheat on the tests to measure nitrogen oxide emit from tha car, and it's not technical glitches as VW said. 

8. 根据之前的步骤，解决所考虑的问题，回答您在步骤2中确定的问题。此外，为您的答案提供简短的理由。

   As engineers at VW, they should have more actions to avoid public being hurt by their prodeuct. While they also have a duty of obey the instruction from their employer, VW, but that duty would not include conﬁdentiality regarding illegal activities. 

   If the company insist to sell these cars with discharge issues, then VW is violating some organizational ethical principles, including principles (1), (3)and (6); Further more, Kitten also violate principles on related to public safety (1), human rights (2), and truthful disclosure (6). 

   What should engineers do? They should take action to protect the public because they have this obligation. What should VW do? VW has an obligation to not make the public hurt.

   Engineers could talk to their employer, VW or public what they knows directly to the public, making a statement to the media. Both of these actions could make engineers in trouble because they may be thought to be employees that not official loyal to their sovereign. 

9. 找出实际的限制因素，列出任何可以合理地说可以为个人或组织提供答案的理由。

   Practical constraints that may influence engineers is physical threats against their life, the nature of corporate retaliation. If he is fired, his family will lose the only money source. So the ethical requirement for Wang don't change, which means he may not to act as a pure engineer.

   Other types of practical constraints that we should cinsider is VW's pressure. As one of the best company in the car industry, VW were suffer a lot of pressure. If there were not as good as people thought or there were any other car company which invent cars with higher performance, VW's position will not be guaranteed. So they want to manufacturing gimmucks without strength.

10. 最后，根据案例研究分析的先前步骤，首先解释道德问题是如何避免的。

    Engineers can take themselves away from the big trouble that this product may pollutes the environment and hurt the public. If VW sell cars with discharge issues, the measured result by the fixed emissions tests will be good looking, but It will cause safety latent danger. If VW don't, cars assembled by this company may lose the war with other cars industries company. But this is just got away with an ethical duty. This escapism is not a good way to avoid ethical problem. There is a better way to avoid this ethical problem. VW can strengthen research and development, and develope cars with low pollution instead of with a "defeat devices" or "clean program", VW can ensure its work this way and avoiding Ethical Problems.
