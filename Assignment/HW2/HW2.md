#HW 2

Please complete steps six through ten of the case-study procedure on A Heating Unit Defect. Revise and include at the beginning the work you did previously for Case-study homework #1, steps one through five.

6. ==Identify ethical principles== that would be relevant for resolving the issue under consideration, starting with the principles for ethical global engineering outlined in chapter four, providing a very brief explanation of why they are relevant. If these principles conflict, then be sure to prioritize them, explaining which ones would be more/less important and why. If you think additional principles apply, then list these as well.

7. Review the process thus far, making sure you have listed all relevant facts, as well as clarified any remaining potentially ambiguous terminology.
8. Based on the previous steps, resolve the issue under consideration, answering the question you identified in step 2. Additionally, give a brief justification for your answer.
9. Identify practical constraints, listing any that could reasonably be said to excuse either individuals or organizations from the answer given.
10. Finally, based on the previous steps of the case study analysis, explain how ethical problems might have been avoided in the first place.

As with all your work in this class, the case-study homework should be written in your own words, meaning you should summarize rather than simply copy from the text. If you do use words and phrases from the text, however, then be sure to include any words or phrases in quotation marks.

## Answer

6. ==Identify ethical principles==进行道德分析

Conflict: 员工：4-7, 4-9 to 3-1, 3-4

企业：1.1, 1.6, 2.1

Q6

Since Kitten Manufacturing Company is a big company and its prodeuct will influence many families, which means as an engineer, responsibilities related to Wang are strongly connected. Referring to the list in Appendix 1, basic ethical principles include principles on related to public safety (1), human rights (2), and truthful disclosure (6). 

While does these questions are related to the job does by Wang? This project is his most recent assignment, which began four months ago. And Wang is the engineer who made it. Which means it's his job to make this prodeuct safety. According to ethical principles for employees, Wang should "obey all legitimate, job-related directives"(1) and "avoid actions that harm the corporation in acting on behalf of the organization"(4), but there is a conflict. As right for enginner as employees says, Wang should "blow the whistle (externally or internally) if, in their professional judg- ments, the physical safety of the public will be endangered as a result of their failures to act" (7) and "inform the public of engineering decisions that have the potential to seriously harm the physical welfare of the public"(9). 

Like the case of ehical analyses, Wang should make his decision on his knowledge and take his responsibilities as an engineer.

7.审查过程

考虑到wang是家中唯一的经济来源，他的父母都需要他来照顾，因此他不能失去这份工作。他作为工程师有义务防止危害公共安全的事情发生，而且这个加热器是他直接管辖 - 而工程被认为是一种社会实验 - 那么George将有责任跟进他的工程/生产活动产生的产品。他也是这个公司的员工，有义务去维持公司不破产。

Considering this situation, Wang needs to take care of his parents who can not live alon because of disable bodies. Which means Wang need this job to live his fimily. Though it's his job to make a good heater, his employer says that it's ok to sell not finished product, so he can just obey the instruction. But as an engineer, Wang have a responsibility to follow up on the products resulting from his  production activities. We can not just consider him as a engineer, though his actions is connected with engineering actions, he is alse the son of his disabled parents.

8. 澄清问题

   虽然他对其雇主负有保密义务，但该义务不包括有关非法活动的保密性。

   如果公司坚持出售问题产品，那么久违反了几条组织伦理原则，包括原则企业：1.1, 1.6, 2.1

   Wang应该采取什么行动或行动？ 由于wang有作为工程师的义务来保护公众，而Kitten有义务不伤害公众，因此任何保护公众的行动或行动都符合道德规范。 因此，wang可以与他的公司上级交谈或直接向公众发表言论，例如向媒体发表声明。 这两项行动都可能给wang造成麻烦，==然而，这使他被视为一个不忠诚的员工。==

   As an engineer, Wang should have more actions to avoid public being hurt by his prodeuct. While he has a duty of obey the instruction from his employer, that duty would not include conﬁdentiality regarding illegal activities. 

   If the company insist to sell these product with safety issues, then kitten is violating some organizational ethical principles, including principles (1), and (6); Further more, Kitten also violate principles on related to public safety (1), human rights (2), and truthful disclosure (6). 

   What should Wang do? He should take action to protect the public because he has this obligation. What should Kitten do? Kitten has an obligation to not make the public hurt.

   Wang could talk to his employer or public what he knows directly to the public, making a statement to the media. Both of these actions could make Wang in trouble because he may be thought to  be a employee that not official loyal to his sovereign. 

9. 确定实际约束条件

   wang有父母需要照料。他有着良好的品德，将问题产品上报。但是公司遭遇财政危机，

   可以考虑的其他类型的实际约束包括对一个人生命的物理威胁，公司报复的性质以及可怕的个人情况。 wang的道德要求即使不能合理地期望他采取行动。

   Wang's parents are disable and he has to take care of them. From this situation we can find that Wang has good charecter. Due to his good charecter, he could be a good engineer, so he should talk to his employer for this product. But if he post this to public, Kitten will be in some financial difficulties.

   Other types of practical constraints that we should cinsider is physical threats against Wang's life, the nature of corporate retaliation. If he is fired, his family will lose the only money source. So the ethical requirement for Wang don't change, which means he may not to act as a pure engineer.

10. 避免道德问题

    Wang可能为自己省去了麻烦 - 如果发现kitten的行为并且通过不遵循卡车而揭露乔治知道他们的话。 但是，这可能是以履行道德责任为代价的。 因此，这种回避机动不会成为避免道德问题的一种方法。 避免道德问题的一个更好的方法可能是马上制作新的产品，或确保一个人为公司工作，有道德的同事。

    Wang can take himself away from the big trouble that this product may hurt the public. If this batch of product can't be sold Kitten may be in some much more serious financial difficulties and he may lost his job, which means there will be no man to feed this family. But this is just got away with an ethical duty. This escapism is not a good way to avoid ethical problem. There is a better way to avoid this ethical problem. Kitten can borrow money to live through this hard time and Wang can come up with a perfect prodeuct, then after selling these good prodeuct, Kitten can ensure its work this way and avoiding Ethical Problems.
