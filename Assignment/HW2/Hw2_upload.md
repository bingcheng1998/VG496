##Q6

*Identify ethical principles that would be relevant for resolving the issue under consideration*

Since Kitten Manufacturing Company is a big company and its prodeuct will influence many families, which means as an engineer, responsibilities related to Wang are strongly connected. Referring to the list in Appendix 1, basic ethical principles include principles on related to public safety (1), human rights (2), and truthful disclosure (6). 

While does these questions are related to the job does by Wang? This project is his most recent assignment, which began four months ago. And Wang is the engineer who made it. Which means it's his job to make this prodeuct safety. According to ethical principles for employees, Wang should "obey all legitimate, job-related directives"(1) and "avoid actions that harm the corporation in acting on behalf of the organization"(4), but there is a conflict. As right for enginner as employees says, Wang should "blow the whistle (externally or internally) if, in their professional judg- ments, the physical safety of the public will be endangered as a result of their failures to act" (7) and "inform the public of engineering decisions that have the potential to seriously harm the physical welfare of the public"(9). 

Like the case of ehical analyses, Wang should make his decision on his knowledge and take his responsibilities as an engineer.

## Q7

*Review the process thus far, making sure you have listed all relevant facts, as well as clarified any remaining potentially ambiguous terminology.*

Considering this situation, Wang needs to take care of his parents who can not live alon because of disable bodies. Which means Wang need this job to live his fimily. Though it's his job to make a good heater, his employer says that it's ok to sell not finished product, so he can just obey the instruction. But as an engineer, Wang have a responsibility to follow up on the products resulting from his  production activities. We can not just consider him as a engineer, though his actions is connected with engineering actions, he is alse the son of his disabled parents.

## Q8

*Based on the previous steps, resolve the issue under consideration*

As an engineer, Wang should have more actions to avoid public being hurt by his prodeuct. While he has a duty of obey the instruction from his employer, that duty would not include conÔ¨Ådentiality regarding illegal activities. 

If the company insist to sell these product with safety issues, then kitten is violating some organizational ethical principles, including principles (1), and (6); Further more, Kitten also violate principles on related to public safety (1), human rights (2), and truthful disclosure (6). 

What should Wang do? He should take action to protect the public because he has this obligation. What should Kitten do? Kitten has an obligation to not make the public hurt.

Wang could talk to his employer or public what he knows directly to the public, making a statement to the media. Both of these actions could make Wang in trouble because he may be thought to  be a employee that not official loyal to his sovereign. 

## Q9

*Identify practical constraints, listing any that could reasonably be said to excuse either individuals or organizations from the answer given.*

Wang's parents are disable and he has to take care of them. From this situation we can find that Wang has good charecter. Due to his good charecter, he could be a good engineer, so he should talk to his employer for this product. But if he post this to public, Kitten will be in some financial difficulties.

Other types of practical constraints that we should cinsider is physical threats against Wang's life, the nature of corporate retaliation. If he is fired, his family will lose the only money source. So the ethical requirement for Wang don't change, which means he may not to act as a pure engineer.

## Q10

*Based on the previous steps of the case study analysis, explain how ethical problems might have been avoided in the first place.*

Wang can take himself away from the big trouble that this product may hurt the public. If this batch of product can't be sold Kitten may be in some much more serious financial difficulties and he may lost his job, which means there will be no man to feed this family. But this is just got away with an ethical duty. This escapism is not a good way to avoid ethical problem. There is a better way to avoid this ethical problem. Kitten can borrow money to live through this hard time and Wang can come up with a perfect prodeuct, then after selling these good prodeuct, Kitten can ensure its work this way and avoiding Ethical Problems.
