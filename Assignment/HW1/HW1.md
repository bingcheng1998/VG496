# HW 1

Please complete steps one through five of the case-study procedure on A Heating Unit Defect, which you can find here: [A Heating Unit Defect.pdf](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/791/files/112980/download?wrap=1)[![在新窗口中查看](https://umjicanvas.com/images/popout.png)](https://umjicanvas.com/courses/791/files/112980/download?wrap=1)

1. List as many ethical issues as possible - remember, ethical issues concern what individuals/organizations should or should not have done/might or might not have done, and are posed in the form of a question - providing a brief explanation for why the issue is ethical in nature.

2. Choose the most important one - or reformulate a new issue that encapsulates multiple issues from step one - providing a brief (one- to two-sentence) explanation for why this issue is the most important.  

3. List facts that would help to resolve the most important issue/answer the question - paying special attention to material, individual, and organizational facts - as well as identifying any relevant missing facts.

4. Make reasonable assumptions regarding missing facts, including brief justifications for your assumptions.

5. Clarify the use of any potentially ambiguous terminology you've used so far - for example, technical or value terms, like "safe," "good," and "responsible."

As with all your work in this class, the case-study homework should be written in your own words, meaning you should summarize rather than simply copy from the text. If you do use words and phrases from the text, however, then be sure to include any words or phrases in quotation marks.

请完成A加热装置缺陷案例研究程序的第一至第五步骤，您可以在此处找到：A加热装置缺陷.pdf 

\ 1。列出尽可能多的道德问题 - 请记住，道德问题涉及个人/组织应该或不应该做或可能做或不做的事情，并以问题的形式提出 - 提供一个简要解释为什么问题是道德本质。 

\ 2。选择最重要的一个 - 或重新制定一个包含第一步中的多个问题的新问题 - 提供一个简短的（一到两个句子）解释为什么这个问题是最重要的。 

\ 3。列出有助于解决最重要问题/回答问题的事实 - 特别关注材料，个人和组织事实 - 以及识别任何相关的缺失事实。 

\ 4。对缺失的事实做出合理的假设，包括对您的假设的简要理由。 

\ 5。澄清到目前为止您使用的任何可能含糊不清的术语的使用 - 例如，技术或价值术语，如“安全”，“好”和“负责任”。 

与本课程中的所有工作一样，案例研究作业应该用您自己的语言写成，这意味着您应该总结而不是简单地从文本中复制。但是，如果您确实使用了文本中的单词和短语，请务必在引号中包含任何单词或短语

## TA's announcement

A student from our course sent me these questions: "In question 3, we are asked to list facts that would help to resolve the problem. What kind of fact are we supposed to find? Are we going to list probable suggestions or important things ignored by the characters?"

In case you have similar questions, my response is as follows: "You should list facts that would help one to resolve/answer the most important ethical issue you identified in step two, for example, facts related to engineering, individuals, and organizations. So, for example, if you decided the most important ethical issue was '<u>Should Derek's elderly parents live with him</u>?' - and I'm not saying I think this is the most important issue in the case, but, if it were, then - facts related to this issue would be, for instance, 'Derek's mother is very depressed' and 'Dereks's father is unable to work.' Facts about his parents might allow one to answer/decide on this issue. In step 4 you should <u>identify missing facts</u>, so an example of that might be: 'Can Derek's mother work?' That's a bit of information that would be relevant to resolving the issue, which isn't provided in the case."

我们课程中的一名学生向我发送了以下问题：“在问题3中，我们被要求列出有助于解决问题的事实。我们应该找到什么样的事实？我们是否会列出可能的建议或忽略的重要事项由人物？“

如果您有类似的问题，我的回答如下：“您应列出有助于解决/回答您在第二步中确定的最重要道德问题的事实，例如，与工程，个人和组织相关的事实。所以，例如，如果你认为最重要的道德问题是“德里克的年迈父母应该与他同住吗？” - 我并不是说我认为这是案件中最重要的问题，但是，如果是，那么 - 与此问题相关的事实将是，例如，'Derek的母亲非常沮丧'和'Dereks的父亲是无法工作。“关于他父母的事实可能允许一个人回答/决定这个问题。在第四步中你应该找出遗漏的事实，所以一个例子可能是：“德里克的母亲可以工作吗？”这是与解决问题相关的一些信息，但案件中没有提供这些信息。“

## Answer

### Q1

  1. Should Wang take care of his parents?
  2. Should Wang restart to design absolutely new units but can not be ready on time?
  3. Should Wang report that some units could cause overheating to Lu?
  4. Should Lu tell Wang that they don't have enough time?
  5. Should Lu tell Wang that Kitten is in some "financial difficulties" confidentially?
  6. Should Kitten sell the units with safety hazards then recall them later?
  7. Should customers be informed of the safety hazard before purchasing these devices?

### Q2 

- "*Should Kitten sell the units with safety hazards then recall them later*" is the most important one. 
- Though this may be one of the "most effective way" to solve the problem, but it take risks. If there exist one unit that to be used more than 2000 hours, it could possibly cause overheating and it may hurt customers. But Kitten is in some financial difficulties, if they don't sell these units, Kitten may go broke. "Damn if you do, damn if you don't".

### Q3

 facts:

1. His testing of the part shows that it will fail within the first 2000 hours of service in about one out of thousand units in which it is to be installed. - About 0.1 percent of units will "fail" with service within 2000 hours.
2. Kitten is in some financial difficulties. - Kittens have some "financial difficulties".
3. The most "cost effective" way to survive economic difficulties is sell these units with safety hazards then recall most of them. 
4. Before any problems arise, it's possible that most of the units with safety hazards will be recalled . 

### Q4

missing facts:

1. If Kitten doesn't sell these units, will the company go broke?
2. Is it responsible for Kitten to sell these units?
3. Will some problems arise before some of these unsafe units be recalled?
4. Will some customers being hurt by these units?

### Q5

potentially ambiguous terminology:

1. Responsible: keep customers safety.
2. Safe: will not cause "overheating" and unable to cause a fire.
3. Hurt: be burned by fire.
4. Fail: may cause "overheating" and may cause a fire.
5. Safety hazards: Same as "Fail"
