**Facts not provided but relevant**

- 百度是否对广告投放对象的资质进行审查？
- Did Baidu review the qualifications of advertising products?
- Did Baidu have the right to mix paid searching results with natural searching results?
- 百度的竞价排名是否得到了公司上层的同意？还是广告部门的私自作为？

- ~~魏则西是否是第一次由于百度不负责任的广告发生的医疗事故？~~

对缺失的事实做出合理的假设，包括对您的假设的简要理由。

First, if Baidu reviewed the qualifications of advertising products, Baidu should refuse to advertise the putian Medical Group, and from this point of view, Baidu did not review the qualifications of advertising products. But on the other hand, the putian Medical Group paid 12 billion RMB per year to Baidu, and Baidu may eviewed the qualifications of it but still advertised the putian Medical Group.

Second, if it's legal to mix paid searching results with natural searching results without telling the user, Baidu should not delete advertisement of the hospital. So Baidu should not do that.

Third, because Baidu were paid 12 billion RMB per year, company management must know that. So Baidu’s bidding ranking policy was approved by the company’s management.

Forth, this hospital was not a Top-three hospital as Baidu said. Besides, Baidu said it had highly efficient immunotherapy and cooperation with Stanford, which is absolutly fraudulent. But the Putian Medical Group should have medical qualifications or it can not get hospital license and still open to patients. 

Fifth, Baidu claimed that  Beijing Armed Police Corps have an experimental treatment for Wei's condition, which means Baidu don't want to take responsibility of Wei's death. And if Baidu compensates Wei's family, it's likely that many similar families will ask Baidu for compensation. So it is very likely that Baidu did not give compensation to Wei Zexi’s family.

澄清到目前为止您使用的任何可能含糊不清的术语的使用 - 例如，技术或价值术语，如“安全”，“好”和“负责任”。

promotion: Baidu defined this service as a “promotion” instead of “advertisement”, though they are similar to each other, promotion refers to any type of marketing communication used to persuade people of the relative merits of a product and service. 



确定与解决所考虑问题相关的道德原则，从第四章中概述的道德全球工程原则开始，简要说明其相关原因。如果这些原则发生冲突，那么一定要优先考虑这些原则，然后解释哪些原则会更重要/更不重要。如果您认为其他原则适用，请列出这些原则。

Baidu is one of world’s largest internet company, China’s largest search engine and the largest Chinese searching engine in the world. So its prodeuct will influence many families, which means as a company, responsibilities related to Baidu are strongly connected. Referring to the list in Appendix 1, these include principles related to public safety (1), human rights (2), and truthful disclosure (6). As a big company, Baidu should endeavor to avoid producing unnecessary harms to those in and outside of their organizations (1). 

Baidu owns more than 6000 million users and has approximately 70% market share. It has lots of products across hundreds of different fields including Baidu Online Marketing Service. So Baidu should keep members of the public safe from "serious negative consequences" resulting from it's advertiments or a large number of people will suffer. Such that principles (1) and (2) seem to apply to Baidu's promotion service. Further more, Advertisements of this hospital on Baidu said it had highly efficient immunotherapy and cooperation with Stanford, but it's not ture. In fact, this hospital had a high priority among all the searching results only because it had paid a lot of money to Baidu. So truthful disclosure principle (6) and avoid producing unnecessary harms principle (1) should be apply to Baidu's fake advertisments.
