Case Study: Case of Wei Zexi

**General case description**

On April 12, 2018, Wei Zexi, a 21-year-old Chinese university student, passed away at home because of cancer. However, things behind this case showed that Wei’s death had a considerable correlation with Baidu, one of world’s largest internet company. As reported by MIT Press, “Wei Zexi, a 21-year-old student Chinese student, was treated for a rare form of cancer with radiation and chemotherapy; when these did not work, he looked online for other options. He found a hospital in Beijing that claimed to have an experimental treatment for his condition, but after travelling to the hospital and taking the expensive treatment, he found it was neither effective nor experimental.”(MIT Press, 2016) 

Wei Zexi had wasted a lot of time and money doing the useless treatment which was promoted to him by the searching results from Baidu. He told the media, “We thought: Baidu, a top-ranked hospital ... everything must be legitimate, A Chinese student in the United States helped me Google relevant information…Only then did we find out that American hospitals had long stopped using the technology (used in the treatment) due to poor results in clinical trials.” 

The Beijing Armed Police Corps was the Hospital provided from Baidu to Wei when he was searching for treatment methods for his synovial sarcoma. Wei and his family chose this hospital because it ranked very high in the searching results and It’s advertisements on Baidu said it had highly efficient immunotherapy and cooperation with Stanford. It turned out later that this hospital had a high priority among all the searching results only because it had paid a lot of money to Baidu and set advertisement through Baidu marketing service. The information on its advertisement on Baidu are mostly false and this hospital was not a Top-three hospital as promoted on the advertisement on Baidu but a “Putian Medical Group” which refers to a groups of private hospitals. 

Wei accepted the treatment from the Beijing Armed Police Corps because of the trust to the information from Baidu. He and his family are also promise by the person in charge in the hospital that the treatment can keep Wei safe for at least 20 years. However, after taking the treatment for four times and spending more than 200 thousand RMB, Wei didn’t get any better. Finally, Wei passed away at home and before his death he “blamed China’s largest search engine, Baidu, for directing him to the hospital by providing him with paid advertisements that masqueraded as objective information.” (MIT Press, 2016)

案例研究：魏泽熙案

一般情况说明

2018年4月12日，21岁的中国大学生魏泽熙因癌症在家中去世。然而，这起案件背后的事情表明，魏的死与百度有着相当大的关联，百度是全球最大的互联网公司之一。正如麻省理工学院出版社报道的那样，“21岁的中国留学生魏泽熙因放射和化疗而接受了罕见的癌症治疗;当这些不起作用时，他在网上寻找其他选择。他在北京找到一家医院，声称对他的病情进行了实验性治疗，但在去医院接受昂贵的治疗后，他发现这既不是有效的也不是实验性的。“（麻省理工学院出版社，2016）

魏泽熙花了很多时间和金钱做了无用的治疗，这是由百度的搜索结果提升给他的。他告诉媒体，“我们想：百度，排名第一的医院......一切都必须合法，一位在美国的中国学生帮助了我谷歌的相关信息......只有这样我们才发现美国医院早已停止使用由于临床试验结果不佳，该技术（用于治疗）。“

北京武警总队是百度到魏医院，他正在为他的滑膜肉瘤寻找治疗方法。 Wei和他的家人之所以选择这家医院是因为它在搜索结果中排名很高，并且它在百度上的广告说它与斯坦福大学有高效的免疫治疗和合作。事后证明，这家医院在所有搜索结果中都占有优先地位，这只是因为它向百度支付了大量资金并通过百度营销服务设置了广告。关于百度广告的信息大多是虚假的，这家医院不是百度广告推广的三甲医院，而是一个“莆田医疗集团”，指的是一组私立医院。

由于对百度信息的信任，魏接受了北京武警总队的待遇。他和他的家人也承诺，医院的负责人表示，治疗可以保持魏安全至少20年。然而，经过四次治疗并花费超过20万人民币后，魏并没有好转。最后，魏在家中去世，在他去世前，他“指责中国最大的搜索引擎百度通过向他提供伪装成客观信息的付费广告来指导他到医院。”（麻省理工学院出版社，2016）

**Background of Baidu promotion service and Baidu’s relationship with Putian Medical Group**

Baidu is China’s largest search engine and the largest Chinese searching engine in the world. It owns more than 6000 million users and has approximately 70% market share. It has lots of products across hundreds of different fields including Baidu Online Marketing Service which may be one of the main reason for the tragedy of Wei Zexi. 

​       Enterprises can set their advertisements on Baidu and try to get a high rank on the searching list of Baidu by giving money to buy the service. Baidu defined this service as a “promotion” instead of “advertisement” but actually Baidu doesn’t have a strict supervision on the advertisement it shows to the public and it mixes paid searching results with natural searching results. This kind of “paid listing” of Baidu has been under controversy from public for a long time.

​       The Putian Medical Group, including the Beijing Armed Police Corps in Wei’s case, is also benefit from Baidu promotion service. “The Putian Medical Group refers to an organized group of entrepreneurs that originally come from the city of Putian, Fujian province, and who have set up private hospitals all over China.” (Koetse, 2016) It turns out that there are close ties between Baidu and Putian. Baidu make fortune through the Putian Medical Group and Putian get more customers by paying money buying Baidu’s services. “Already in 2013, Putian’s Communist Party chief stated that Putian hospitals may have contributed 12 billion RMB of the total of 26 billion RMB in ad revenues reported by Baidu that year.” (Koetse, 2016)

“On the other hand, it is also because of Baidu’s top-ranking advertising space that the Putian Medical Group has been able to further expand their business and gain high profits within China’s healthcare industry.”(Koetse, 2016)

**Baidu response and public response**

After Wei Zexi passed away, on about May 1st, 2016, the case of Wei Zexi had raised a wide concern among the public and media. The public accused Baidu of seeking for money and ignoring its social responsibility. The government and relative department also investigated Baidu after this case.

​       On April. 28, 2016, Baidu respond to the media and public that they have check that the hospital which Wei received treatment in is a public professional hospital. Meanwhile, the relation advertisement of the hospital on Baidu were all deleted.

​       “On May 2nd , a joint investigation team ,which was set up by State Information Office, SAIC, the National Health&Family Planning Commission and the related Beijing authorities,stationed in Baidu. Investigations had been launched by the team, centered around the problems of Beidu Search in “Wei Zexi Incident”and PPC search mechanism defects of Baidu. The team believes that Baidu PPC search related keyword results objectively have an impact on Wei Zexi’s selection of hospital. In fact, Baidu PPC search mechanism really exists a lots of problems as high proportion of Paid bids, unclear business promotion identity,etc. These issues affect the impartiality and objectivity of search results, will mislead users easily, therefore must be immediate rectification.” (Admin, 2016) And Baidu responded to the team that it will take effect in 5 aspects:

1. “Baidu will immediately make a comprehensive review of all medical class of business promotion services, firmly refuse to provide business promotion to those medical institutions that not obtained the qualified approval of the competent authorities, at the same time timely offline the offending medical category promotional information (including drugs, medical devices, etc.)” (Admin, 2016)

2. “For commercial promotion results, Baidu will change its old price-based sorting mechanism to a new sorting mechanism of credibility with a price supplement.” (Admin, 2016)

3. “Control the number of results on Business promotion,strictly limit the number of business promotion information on the search result page, especially on the first page. And the proportion of the business promotion information on each page will be under 30%.” (Admin, 2016)

4. “Clearly marked all business promotion information in all search results to make effective risk warning.”(Admin, 2016)

5. “Strengthen the ecological construction of the medical content in search results. Establishing the rating system to medical content. United Methodist Planning Commission, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and other institutions to improve the quality of medical information, helping users to get accurate and authoritative health information and services.” (Admin, 2016)

 百度推广服务背景与百度与莆田医疗集团的关系

百度是中国最大的搜索引擎，也是全球最大的中文搜索引擎。它拥有超过6000万用户，拥有约70％的市场份额。它拥有包括百度在线营销服务在内的数百个不同领域的大量产品，这可能是魏泽西悲剧的主要原因之一。

       企业可以在百度上设置广告，并试图通过捐款购买服务在百度搜索列表中获得较高的排名。百度将此服务定义为“促销”而非“广告”，但实际上百度对其向公众展示的广告没有严格的监督，并且将付费搜索结果与自然搜索结果混合。百度的这种“付费上市”长期以来一直受到公众的争议。
    
       莆田医疗集团，包括魏案的北京武警总队，也受益于百度推广服务。 “莆田医疗集团是指一群有组织的企业家，最初来自福建省莆田市，并在全国各地设立了私立医院。”（Koetse，2016）事实证明，两者之间存在密切联系。百度和莆田。百度通过莆田医疗集团发财，莆田通过付钱购买百度的服务获得更多客户。 “截至2013年，莆田市委书记已表示，莆田医院可能在当年百度报告的广告收入总额260亿元人民币中贡献了120亿元人民币。”（Koetse，2016）

“另一方面，正是由于百度的顶级广告空间，莆田医疗集团能够进一步拓展业务，并在中国的医疗保健行业中获取高额利润。”（Koetse，2016）

百度响应和公众回应

魏泽熙去世后，2016年5月1日，魏泽熙案引起了公众和媒体的广泛关注。公众指责百度寻求金钱而无视其社会责任。在此案之后，政府和相关部门也对百度进行了调查。

       在四月。 2016年8月28日，百度回应媒体和公众，他们已经检查了魏医生接受治疗的医院是一家公立专业医院。同时，百度医院的关系广告全部删除。
    
       “5月2日，由国家信息办公室，国家工商总局，国家卫生和计划生育委员会及相关北京当局组建的联合调查小组驻扎在百度。该团队已经开展调查，围绕“魏泽西事件”中的Beidu搜索问题和百度的PPC搜索机制缺陷进行了调查。该团队认为，百度PPC搜索相关关键词结果客观上对魏泽熙的医院选择产生了影响。事实上，百度PPC搜索机制确实存在很多问题，如支付出价比例高，业务推广身份不明确等。这些问题影响搜索结果的公正性和客观性，会轻易误导用户，因此必须立即纠正。“（管理员，2016）百度回应团队认为它将在5个方面生效：

1.“百度将立即对所有医疗类商业推广服务进行全面审查，坚决拒绝向未获得主管部门合格批准的医疗机构提供业务推广，同时及时离线违规医疗类别促销信息（包括药品，医疗器械等）“（Admin，2016）

1.“对于商业推广结果，百度将把旧的基于价格的分拣机制改为新的信誉分拣机制，并附带价格补充。”（Admin，2016）

1.“控制商业促销的结果数量，严格限制搜索结果页面上的商业促销信息的数量，尤其是在第一页上。每页商业促销信息的比例将低于30％。“（管理员，2016）
