## Chapter 9

● explain the nature of loyalty and of legitimate authority and their relation to faithful agency;

**nature of loyalty:** Corporate employ- ees should endeavor to obey all legitimate, job-related directives.

**nature of legitimate authority**: Those in positions of au- thority are able to give orders, but engineers are not always obliged to follow all such orders.

Engineers have a **duty of loyalty** to the organizations in which they work, assuming organizational directives are based on **legitimate authority**. Engineers should act as **faithful agents** of the companies for which they work: doing a good job as an employee consists in a relation of faithful agency, taking on the interests of the organization as one's own. 

● describe the nature of and give specific examples of **conflicts of interests** [利益冲突];

**Nature of conflicts of interests:**  acting autonomously, based on their duties to the public.

**Examples**: 1.  when engineers have second, 2. part-time jobs, 3. use information learned at their employers for personal gain, 4. are offered gifts or bribes, 5. show favoritism in hiring/subcontracting work. [任选一个即可]

● explain the **different forms** of whistle-blowing[举报] and conditions under which whistle-blowing would be morally permissible and required.

Two forms of whistle-blowing, **internal** and **external**.

**Internal whistle-blowing** occurs when a hierarchical chain of command within an organization is broken (such that immediate supervisors are bypassed, perhaps because they have refused to act or have themselves been involved in wrongdoing). 

**External whistle-blowing** occurs when information internal to an organization is shared externally (perhaps with regulatory agencies, the press, or public).

●解释忠诚和合法权威的性质及其与忠诚机构的关系;
●描述利益冲突的性质并给出具体的例子;
●解释不同形式的举报和在道德上允许和要求举报的条件。

## Chapter 10

● with regard to the case of Qihoo 360's P1 wireless router, explain why it is important for the public to have an adequate grasp of the ways technologies work and the responsibilities engineers have for this understanding;

Case

● describe the reasons for and problems associated with the gulf in understanding that exists between the sciences-engineering and the humanities-public and what engineers might do to bridge this gap;

1.**scientists** conceive the world in rational terms, where the notion of progress and efficiency dominates. Scientists believe the future lies in their hands and that this future is filled with the wonders of technologies—a view generally associated with “technological optimism.” 

2.the **humanities** conceive the world in intuitive terms, where reason can only provide partial and biased answers. The central concerns of the humanities are human meaning and the fulfillment of broader missions.

What to do: **Communication** is necessary, since the future involves everyone. This can only occur if each side is empathetic to the other, explicitly recognizing the value of the other.

● outline the nature of and reasons for ***responsibilities*** that engineers, as a group, have to **public participation**, **education**, and **engagement**, giving examples from the case studies in this chapter;

**nature**: as a group, engineers have a responsibility to establish communication with nonengineers, insuring that broader nontechnical concerns are considered.

**reasons**:  Such that the responsibility of the group would be fulfilled. 

● explain the relationship between laws and ethics, why strictly adhering to laws alone is insufficient, and how engineers might approach the law in international and cross-cultural contexts;

**relationship**: Having different foundations, laws and ethics are instantiated in different ways.

**how**: P170页六条lists

● discuss the importance of being sensitive to local needs in the formulation and implementation of international aid work related to engineering and technologies.

**importance**: This is especially true in international, globalized environments, where a failure to do so can result in wasted time, effort, and money.

●关于奇虎360 P1无线路由器的情况，解释为什么公众必须充分掌握技术工作方式以及工程师对此理解的责任。
●描述理解科学工程与人文科学之间存在的鸿沟的原因和问题，以及工程师可以采取哪些措施来弥合这一差距;
●概述工程师作为一个群体必须参与公众参与，教育和参与的责任的性质和原因，并举例说明本章的案例研究;
●解释法律与道德之间的关系，为什么仅仅严格遵守法律是不够的，以及工程师如何在国际和跨文化背景下接近法律;
●在制定和实施与工程和技术相关的国际援助工作时，讨论对当地需求敏感的重要性。

## Chapter 11

● explain the relationship between duties and rights and the nature of/basis for rights with regard to moral, civic, and employment communities;

**relationship** between duties and rights:  flip side of duties is rights.

**nature** of rights: A “right” can be understood as an entitlement of an individual.

**moral** rights:  based simply on belonging to a moral community [India dolphins]

**civic** rights: based on membership in a particular nation or community. 

**Employee** rights: are based on membership in a particular company.

● describe the nature and give examples of both **racial** and **sexual** discrimination, and the **relation** between **rights** and **discrimination**;

**sexual** discrimination: resulting in negative effects on the abilities of members of that group to perform their jobs.

**relation**: chief among rights are those protecting individuals from discrimination

● list the rights of employees in general and engineers specifically, and explain problems with and solutions to the enforcement of rights.

●描述性质，举例说明种族歧视和性别歧视，以及权利与歧视之间的关系;
