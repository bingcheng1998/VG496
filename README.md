## About Honor Code

If there is same questions or labs in the future, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these codes, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository dosen't take any commitment for other's faults.

According to the student handbook (2015 version),

> It is a violation of the Honor Code for students to submit, as their own, work that is not the result of their own labor and thoughts. This applies, in particular, to ideas, expressions or work obtained from other students as well as from books, the internet, and other sources. The failure to properly credit ideas, expressions or work from others is considered plagiarism.

**1. Course Description**

The ultimate goal of this course is your development as not only better engineers but also more responsible global citizens and leaders. It is designed to increase your awareness and understanding of professional and ethical responsibilities in national, international, and cross-cultural environments, helping to anticipate, identify, and navigate issues that will likely arise in your working lives. Towards this end, reflection on your own experience and its ethical ramifications is a fundamental component. The main concern of this course will be with developing your abilities to identify and resolve ethical issues related to technology, as well as its relation to contemporary issues in global, economic, environmental, and social contexts. The course readings, case studies, and exercises are geared towards the development of a well-researched original case study or research project, informed by your past experiences and future aspirations related to technology, which you will present. (Just to dispel any misunderstanding: This is NOT a “water course” (水课) but will be a serious engagement with issues that have the potential to gravely affect you and others in your professional capacities as engineers.) The texts and materials used in this course have been developed for classes on engineering ethics and science, technology, and society studies taught in the US, Japan, Taiwan, and mainland China. For that reason, your active participation is essential – your perspectives as students are invaluable!

 

**2. Texts**

The primary text for this course is *Global Engineering Ethics*, by Heinz Luegenbiehl and Rockwell Clancy, published by Elsevier Press. If you’re connected to SJTU’s network, then you can download a copy of the book: <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/book/9780128112182>.**As laptops, tablets, and other electronic devices are not allowed in class, please print out the text and bring it to each class. Please download this version yourself, rather than an older version and/or getting one from a friend and/or classmate.** Throughout the semester, you will be required to consult news sources, academic articles, books as well. 

 

**3. Course Requirements**

Rather than primarily lectures, the format of this course is based on out-of-class reading, reflection, and research, as well as in-class discussion and exercises. The primary focus will be on discussions of and reflections on the assigned materials, as well as answering reflective questions and completing exercises related to the course readings/case studies. To contribute to class discussions in a meaningful way, it is important that you do the assigned readings before class. Additionally, you should always bring **paper** and a **writing utensil** to this course, since you should take notes[[1\]](#_ftn1), and there’ll be a variety of short writing/reflection exercises you’ll be required to turn in at the end of class.

 

**A. Reading/attendance quizzes and in-class exercises** **(20%)****:** To ensure you attend class, have done and understood the reading, and as a jumping-off point for class discussion, some classes will begin with a short (two to three questions) quiz, concerning the assigned reading for that day, personal reflection, and/or the content covered in the previous class. You will have **seven**minutes to complete the quiz, beginning from the time the bell rings. For that reason, you should arrive to class **on time**, **putting away** everything except a piece of paper and writing utensil, **before** the class and quiz begin. On other days, this part of your grade will be based on individual or group in-class reflection/writing exercises, for example, the worksheets associated with the movies we’ll watch in class. 

 

According to JI regulations, class attendance is **required**, and students who miss over 1/3 of classes **cannot pass**. Participation consists in not only attendance but also, for example, answering questions, asking questions, and completing exercises. You are responsible for all the material covered in class, including lecture content, schedule and policy changes, and other general information. (TIP: Be sure to ask for the contact information of several classmates so you can contact them about what you missed.)

 

To quote the JI policy on leave/missed classes:

a)     “An advance request for leave of absence is required if the student cannot attend the class due to illness or other reasons. Absence without approval will be regarded as skipping classes.”

b)    “A note that a student visited a medical facility is not a sufficient excuse for missing an assignment. The note must specifically indicate that the student was incapable of completing an assignment due to medical problems and that this condition was sudden enough that it was impractical to contact the instructor in advance.”

 

Even with an excused absence, you are required to hand in any work due for the class on time. For example, if you have an approved leave of absence on Monday, you are responsible for handing in any homework at the same time as other students.

 

As research indicates that students learn conceptual content better through taking notes by hand[[2\]](#_ftn2), **you should not use your laptop/tablet in class.** **Check the syllabus and Canvas regularly to keep up with assignments and other information related to the course.** Your lowest **two** reading/attendance quizzes and in-class exercises grades will be **dropped**.

 

**B. Homework assignments (20%):** To think through/reflect on the topics covered and practice employing skills introduced in the course, you will have written homework assignments, consisting mainly in case-study analyses. Be sure to give reasons for your answers, which can be based on information in the case study itself and/or your own knowledge/personal experience. As with other written work for this course, you will be assessed on **form** as much as **content**. Check the **guidelines/grading criteria** for your written work posted on Canvas. If writing is especially troublesome for you, then I encourage you to seek help from the JI’s Writing Center. All late work will be penalized **ten-percentage points** per day. No homework handed in more than **four** days late will be accepted. **Always both submit e-versions and bring hardcopies to class.**

 

**C. Final exam (25%):** To assess your overall grasp of the materials and skills covered throughout the semester, you will have one exam in this course. The exam will consist in short answer questions and a case-study analysis. Without a medical excuse or a verifiable emergency, the exam cannot be made up.

 

**D. Final case study (35% – 10% presentation; 15% written report; 10% abstract):** The largest part of your grade will be based on the development and presentation of a case study related to science/technology and broader social issues, for example, ethics, society, economics, and/or politics, which will be completed in multiple steps with team members. Based on your past experience and future goals related to science/technology, you and your team members will research and develop an original case or research project. **You should utilize at least four reputable English-language sources in writing up your case, using 1-inch margins, 2.0 spaced, twelve-point Times New Roman font, APA style.** (NOTE: **Wikipedia** is not a bad place to start learning about a new topic, but isn’t itself a reputable source. In some cases – especially in those of new technologies and perceptions of and experiences with those technologies – blogs can offer a lot of information/be a useful resource. You can use and refer to blogs, although they should not comprise more than one of your four reputable sources.)

There should not be any significant overlap in cases, meaning each group will present on a different case. Priority will be given on a first-come, first-serve basis. Hence, if you want to present on a particular case/incident/topic, then you should decide this and inform the TA as soon as possible. I’ll post a list of potentially interesting topics early in the semester, in case you’re having a difficult time choosing a topic. The average length of the report will be **ten** to **thirteen** pages (**four** to **five** pages of your reports will **outline/explain** the case, while the second **six** to **eight** pages will **analyze** the case according to the case-study procedure). **Hardcopies** of **drafts** of the written case studies are due in class on **November 20**, while **hardcopies** and **e-versions** of the final versions of case studies are due the week after, **November 27.**

The written cases will outline and analyze what happened/the relevant issues. Your group will also be responsible for a presentation of the case, which will occur during the final week of the semester, **December 11**. You are not allowed to simply read something you’ve written beforehand. If you do so, then you’ll fail this part of the project. Make your presentation visually interesting, for example, by using illustrations, pictures, or graphs.

In preparation for both your written report and presentation, you’ll submit a short abstract – no longer than **one** page, **including** four English-language sources – with a summary of your topic, list of ethical issues, and four English-language sources. You’ll receive feedback on these to improve your final report and presentation. Your grade on all of these will be determined as much by **form** as content – in other words, that your written work follows the conventions of the English language, employs APA style for the references, is free of punctuation, grammar, and syntactical mistakes, etc. Again, check the guidelines/grading criteria for your written work posted on Canvas, and if writing is especially troublesome for you, then I encourage you to seek help from the JI’s Writing Center. **Again, submit eversions and bring hardcopies to class.**

 

**E. Extra-credit (2-percentage points added to your final grade):** To continue to improve the course and materials used therein, you can earn extra-credit points by abbreviating/abridging each chapter of the course text to no more than 1,250 words. Submit a Word document with only those parts of the chapter you feel are the most essential within two weeks of its being assigned. Include a word count at either the beginning or end of the document.

 

**4. Grading Policy**

Final grades for this course will be determined as follows:

Reading/attendance quizzes (and/or other in-class activities)                                               20%

Homework assignments (four case-study analyses)                                                               20%

Final exam                                                                                                                              25%

Final case study                                                                                                                      35%

Extra credit                                                                                                                              +4%

 

Grades will be assigned according to this chart:

| Final average | Course grade | Final average  | Course grade |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| 98% and above | A+           | 77% and above  | C+           |
| 93% and above | A            | 73% and above  | C            |
| 90% and above | A-           | 70% and above  | C-           |
| 87% and above | B+           | 60% and above  | D            |
| 83% and above | B            | 59.9 and below | F            |
| 80% and above | B-           |                |              |

 

**5. Academic Integrity**

All work handed in for this class must be your own. The inclusion of any data, words, or ideas from any other source must be acknowledged, and that source must be given proper credit. Failure to do so is a violation of the Honor Code. Any suspected violation of the Honor Code will be reported to Honor Council for investigation. **In addition to any sanctions you might receive from the Honor Council, plagiarism will result in a failing grade on the assignment, as it will be deemed to have not been satisfactorily completed****.** For this course, plagiarism is defined as:

a)     The use of any passage of **three words or longer** from another source without proper attribution. Use of any phrase of three words or more must be enclosed in quotation marks (“**example, example, example**”). The source of the material must be identified in the text, by a parenthetical reference, footnote, or endnote. 

b)    Use of material from an uncredited source, making very minor changes (like word order or verb tense) to avoid the three-word rule.

c)     Inclusion of **facts**, **data**, **ideas,** or **theories** originally thought of by someone else, without giving that person (organization, etc.) credit. You must identify the source, whether in an endnote, footnote, parenthetical reference, or in the text.

d)    **Paraphrasing** ideas or theories (writing them in your own words) without giving the original thinker proper credit. 

e)     Allowing another person to make extensive changes to your paper. This is considered “unauthorized aid.” (Allowing a friend to check your work for minor errors is fine.)

f)     Use of an electronic translation program such as Google Translate. The use of machine translation programs is classified as “unauthorized aid.”  

 

Even assignments that you have struggled with will result in a grade higher than that of plagiarized work. If you have any questions about what constitutes or how to avoid plagiarism, please do not hesitate to ask.

 

**6. Courtesy**

Please foster a learning atmosphere by respecting classmates, TA’s, and the me. Students are asked to turn off their cell phones or put them on silent when class begins. Please do not play with electronic devices during class. Any discussions about grades should take place calmly. It is recommended that students wait twenty-four hours before contacting an instructor or TA about a disputed grade. If you are speaking while either myself or other students are speaking – or not speaking in English – then I reserve the right to ask you to leave class, as this is disruptive to the learning environment of the course.

 

**7. Language**

As long as students are in the classroom, they should speak English. Students should also speak English when meeting with the TA, although they can (try) to speak with **me** or their fellow, **non-native-Chinese-speaking** classmates in Chinese. I will ask students not speaking in English to leave class. 

 

*This syllabus is tentative and subject to revision as the instructor sees fit.
